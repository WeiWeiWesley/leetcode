## 題目描述
You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

- The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position.

Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.

## 範例

### Example 1:
```
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1807"
  |
"7810"
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
Output: "1A1B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1123"        "1123"
  |      or     |
"0111"        "0111"
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.
